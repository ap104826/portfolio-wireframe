        My name is Arpita Mehta. I am a front end web developer that loves to cook. I have been teaching myself coding for over a year now and because of my interest and passion in this new field I joined Front End Web development bootcamp at Thinkful. I enjoy coding and technology because  it involves logic and being able to see ideas come to life.
